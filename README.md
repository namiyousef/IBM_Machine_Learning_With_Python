# IBM_Machine_Learning_With_Python
A summary of my work from "IBM Machine Learning with Python" course (part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate) on Coursera. This includes my own attempt at doing the labs, as well as my comments.

UPDATE: 16.08.20
Would like to do the final assignment on the course (i.e. after Lab 12) which finds the 'best' classifier on my own Jupyter Notebooks.
Remember to do this.
